# ---- context cache: stay on the engine defaults ----------------------------
# Every context-cache capacity flag is deliberately NOT passed. The defaults
# (docs/serving.md:764-769) at MAX_CONCURRENCY=4 are:
#   device_state_slots            = max_concurrency          -> 4
#   host_state_slots              = 8   (types.h:26 constant)
#   max_private_continuations     = 2 * max_concurrency       -> 8
#   max_shared_prefixes           = max_concurrency           -> 4
#   max_long_anchors_per_continuation = 2
# Overriding them made things worse every time it was tried on this box.
# Measured 2026-09-03, same-elapsed-window A/B at identical traffic, minute 15:
#   host_state_slots=8   -> root 29%, TTFT p50 1.27 s, 2854 recomputed tokens
#   host_state_slots=24  -> root 60%, TTFT p50 5.17 s, 17991 recomputed tokens
# The knee lands exactly when the host slots fill: a larger checkpoint estate
# makes each candidate assessment more expensive, the planner's search budget
# saturates, it evaluates FEWER targets, and it falls back to a root reprefill.
# Upstream issue #144 is the same defect (closed against 138d76ae, but the
# reporter had already reproduced on 21a0e85f which contains it; we are the
# third independent reproduction, on 6e2786c5). Do not "fix" it by raising the
# search budget either: upstream ran the byte-identical 5ms -> 1s patch and it
# changed no selected path, it only added ~1 s to every restore.
# max_shared_prefixes was pinned to 0 here for a while to dodge a wedge. That
# was a misattribution: all 44 "materialization source has no resident state"
# errors happened in generations already running 0. Back on the default.
#
# HOST_KV_MIB is the one deliberate override. Upstream defaults to 8192 and its
# reference config uses the same, but 8 host slots x a p90 session of 1.52 GiB
# needs ~12.2 GiB, and measured peak host KV occupancy at 8 slots was 6.5 GiB.
# 16 GiB covers both with margin. It is a pinned cudaMallocHost arena committed
# at startup and never returned before process exit; it counts in Shmem, and
# swap here is zram (compressed in RAM) so Shmem is effectively unreclaimable.
# Keep total Shmem under ~40 GiB on this 62.5 GiB box: 40 GiB arena + 64 slots
# once reached 49.2 GiB Shmem / 538 MiB MemFree and the box did not recover
# until the container was restarted.
# max_shared_prefixes is back on the engine default (= max_concurrency = 4). It was pinned to 0
# after a wedge on 2026-09-03: one request died with "materialization source has no resident state"
# and every later request got 503 until the container was restarted. The underlying planning defect
# is NOT fixed and is not reproducible under synthetic load, but the blast radius is: a stale
# materialization plan now aborts that one transaction instead of failing the whole Engine
# (program_impl.h prepare_materialization returns false, the caller runs abort_transaction).
# Expect the occasional single-request HTTP 500 rather than a dead process. Watch the JSONL for
# error.message == "materialization source has no resident state"; set this back to 0 if the rate
# is material.
# ---- capacity: `start` (full) vs `start lite` -------------------------
# Lite cuts footprint with TWO levers:
#   1. max_concurrency 1 — the movable VRAM is the device-side paged KV cache +
#      device-state slots, both scaling with concurrency (35B cell measured
#      ~9.5 -> ~2.3 GiB going 4->2; 1 cuts further).
#   2. SPEC=mtp — drops dflash2's ~2.07 GiB standalone draft model (mtp head is
#      in-artifact, no extra VRAM); this also frees pool: mtp:1:nvfp4 gives
#      410,944-token device pool vs dflash2's 188,416.
# Vision, weights, host-KV RAM and the context ceiling stay at max; long
# contexts remain resident in RAM. Env var wins over either profile value
# (e.g. `env MAX_CONCURRENCY=4 start lite`, `env SPEC=dflash2 start lite`).

# device_state_slots defaults to MAX_CONCURRENCY; total device StateImage slots
# = MAX_CONCURRENCY + device_state_slots at ~147 MiB each, so lowering it
# shrinks the device KV pool and its reservation. Engine hard limit is [1,8].

# ---- (VISION, KV_DTYPE) -> MAX_CONTEXT -----------------------------------
# Override per-run without editing. The login shell here is fish, which has no
# `VAR=value cmd` prefix syntax, so use env:
#   env VISION=0 bash ninfer.sh start
#   env VISION=0 KV_DTYPE=fp8 bash ninfer.sh start
#
# The device KV pool is VRAM-capped and depends on BOTH knobs, so --max-context
# has to be chosen per pair and stay <= that pair's own pool (the engine reserves
# a full max-length request's KV). Pools measured with --kv-capacity auto on a
# 32GB RTX 5090, ninfer 21a0e85f, MTP3 on:
#   vision on  + fp8     pool 229376  ->  MAX_CONTEXT=188224  (82%)
#   vision on  + nvfp4   pool 410944  ->  MAX_CONTEXT=262144  (64%)
#   vision off + fp8     pool 257920  ->  MAX_CONTEXT=251392  (97%)
#   vision off + nvfp4   pool 462144  ->  MAX_CONTEXT=262144  (57%, ceiling-bound)
# Pool tokens scale exactly with the KV byte width, so a new dtype's pool is
# predictable to <0.01% -- but measure it before adding a row here anyway.
# 262144 is a hard ceiling regardless of pool size: qwen3_6_27b's kNativeContext
# (src/targets/qwen3_6_27b/impl/config.h) caps --max-context, and exceeding it
# fails startup with "max_context exceeds the variant native context capacity".
# The nvfp4 pools are larger than that ceiling, so their spare capacity goes to
# keeping other sessions' KV resident rather than to a longer single request.
# Vision on additionally caps images/video at 32768 merged tokens; turning it
# off buys ~12% more pool (available-after-weights 10.82 -> 11.10 GiB), not the
# whole media reservation. All pairs keep MTP3 speculative decoding.
VISION="${VISION:-1}"
# ---- speculative decoding: dflash2 (default) | mtp ------------------------
# dflash2 bundles the companion draft model in the v2 artifact (recipe
# qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4-v2, source z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2); mtp uses the
# in-artifact draft. Both accept --lm-head-draft. K range: mtp [1,5], dflash2
# [1,15]. Default K=7 (manifest value). 2026-09-08 A/B vs K=12 (8 prompts,
# sequential, temp 0): decode within noise (mean 211.7 vs 203.7 tok/s, median
# opposite) but acceptance consistently higher at 7 (35.8% vs 23.8%, 8/8
# prompts) -- K=12's extra drafts rarely accept, wasted verification.
